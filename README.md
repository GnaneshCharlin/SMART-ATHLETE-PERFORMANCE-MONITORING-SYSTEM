# SMART-ATHLETE-PERFORMANCE-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This project uses an ESP32, DHT11 (temperature), and MAX30100 (heart rate) sensors to monitor health. It sends the data to the Blynk app and alerts the user if the temperature or heart rate goes too high, allowing for easy remote monitoring and notifications.
